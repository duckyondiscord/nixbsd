# Important modules
- [x] get activation to actually work
- [x] better toplevel
- [x] vm image
- [x] deal with locales
- [x] rc module, so we can have a proper init system
- [x] tempfiles (so that current-system and booted-system don't get garbage collected)
- [x] bootloader
- [x] users (might not need a ton of changes?)
    - [x] Base setup
    - [x] User class defaults
    - [x] initialPassword (have to build perl with crypt or workaround)
- [x] wrappers, so we can get sudo/login/etc
- [x] ssh
- [x] networking (maybe adapt the shell-based nixos stuff?)
- [x] fstab
- [x] fix sudo (currently "Exec format error" in PAM)
- [x] make sure user passwords actually work
- [x] nix-daemon
- [x] hostname
- [x] syslog

# Less important modules
- [x] sysctl
- [ ] xorg/wayland setup
- [ ] GPU drivers
- [ ] Linux emulation
    - [ ] chroot other OS
    - [ ] "chroot" nixpkgs with shared store
    - [ ] "chroot" nixos with service config
- [ ] encrypted rootfs (do we need to put any modules in the boot partition?)
- [ ] jails
- [ ] figure else what else has to be in requiredPackages
- [x] Figure out how to generate documentation
- [x] switch-to-configuration
- [x] nixos-install
- [ ] switch-to-configuration switch
- [ ] fsck

# Nice to have modules
- [ ] syslogd remote listening
- [ ] newsyslog in cron
- [ ] cache nixbsd module documentation

# maybe???
- [ ] veriexec (sign nix store paths, load signatures into kernel)

# Packages
- [ ] Clean up gcc without breaking musl
- [x] Figure out why git is failing
- [ ] Subsetting in locales (save a little build time and like 20MiB)
- [ ] Separate debug from packages (currently bin/.debug contains debug info)
